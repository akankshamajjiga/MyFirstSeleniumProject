In this project, I have learnt the basics of selenium by automating the scenario of gmail login.

in this project,i have learnt about a selector i.e css selector to find the element's of email and password field element's to pass the sendkeys to enter the email 
and password which i want to give and also to find the next button element to click on it.
and how to maximize (or) minimize the browser window.
and wait until condition using different elements like elementtobeclicked,elementtobeselected etc. 
and click and quit driver's to close or to exit the browser.and also explicit wait condition to wait for timeout.
and also how to use setproperty by telling the webdriver to know the path of the chrome driver to open my browser.
we can instantiate the web driver to different web browser's like chrome,firefox etc.
i have learnt about how to get the url of my current web browser.
